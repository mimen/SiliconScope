//  Overview:  The source-agnostic fleet metric schema — the boundary the Mac aggregator consumes
//             for every remote machine, regardless of how the data arrives. Mirrors the Go Linux
//             agent's JSON (agent/main.go) so its output decodes directly, and carries Apple-Silicon
//             extras (E/P split, ANE/Media, per-requestor bandwidth, power breakdown, fans) that a
//             Mac agent fills in. Keeping this UI-independent (Core) is what lets one view render
//             both a Linux GPU box and a headless Mac.
//  Notes:     JSON keys are camelCase matching the property names, so no CodingKeys are needed.
//             Apple-only fields are Optional so Linux JSON (which omits them) still decodes — the
//             UI shows a slot only when its value is present. Byte fields are absolute bytes; `ts`
//             is unix ms. `kind` is "linux" | "mac". All fleet types are `Fleet*`-prefixed to avoid
//             colliding with the local live-monitor snapshot types.
