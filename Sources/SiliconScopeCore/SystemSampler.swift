//  Overview:  Aggregates every SiliconScopeCore sampler into one SystemSnapshot. Intended
//             to run on a single background thread driven by the UI's refresh loop.
//  Notes:     @unchecked Sendable: the underlying samplers hold non-Sendable IOReport
//             handles, but SiliconScope only ever calls sample() from one serial background
//             task, so this is safe. Do not call sample() concurrently. The four delta/sleep
//             samplers (power/CPU/GPU/bandwidth) run in parallel within a single sample() call.
