//  Overview:  The exact set of values DashboardView renders — built either from the live monitor
//             or from a replayed recording frame. Making it one value struct (rather than a
//             protocol) keeps "live and replay are the same shape" a compile-time fact and avoids
//             Observation pitfalls with existentials.
//  Notes:     The live-only display fields (benchmark) are zero/nil in replay; the live-only
//             actions (benchmark, process kill) are gated in DashboardView by whether an
//             onBenchmark closure was supplied. Built fresh inside a view body so @Observable /
//             playhead changes re-render.
